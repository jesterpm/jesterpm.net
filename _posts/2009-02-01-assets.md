I was in need of an asset management system at Puyallup Foursquare Church, so I
developed Assets. I particularly wanted to track computers and what software
was installed on each computer, so each asset has a list of associated assets.
The database is made up of many //items// which have a name, an image, and a
set of fields. For any item there are zero or more //assets.// An asset is
essentially the manifestation of an item.
