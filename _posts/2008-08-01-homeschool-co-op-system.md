In Auguest of 2008 I was asked to build a online registration system and family
directory for [Lighthouse Homeschool Co-op][1]. The system was designed to
accommodate Lighthouse's needs while being flexible enough to reuse for another
co-op. The system was built using PHP, MySQL, and Facebook [Scribe][2] for
logging and has been running since the 2009-2010 school year.
