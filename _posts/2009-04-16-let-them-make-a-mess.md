Experience has proven Brent's *rogerism*, “let the sheep onto the field and they
poop all over it.” But making a mess of things is part of the learning process. If
developing leaders are never given a chance to clean up when they make a mess,
they will never learn how. They will be stuck at square one; they'll never get
to the point where you don't fear giving them control.

What should you do? Slow down and teach then get out of the way. Show them what
needs to be done and how to do it, then step back. Let them do it themselves.
Let them mess up. Be there to support them, but give them a chance to fail. If
you don't risk the result of releasing control, you may never have a mess on
your hands, but you're capping yourself and them. Remember, someone took a risk
with you when you were learning.
