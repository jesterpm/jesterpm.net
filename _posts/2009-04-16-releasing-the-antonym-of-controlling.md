Experience has proven Brent's rogerism, "let the sheep onto the field and they
poop all over it".  Unfortunately, making a mess of things is part of the
learning process. If developing leaders are never given a chance to learn
how to "clean up" when they make a mess, they never will. They'll be stuck at
square one; they'll never get to the point where you don't fear giving them
control.  The antidote? Slow down and teach, then get out of the way.  Show them
what needs to be done and how to do it, then step back. Let them do it
themselves and be there to support them. If you don't risk the result of
releasing control, you may never have a mess on your hands, but you're capping
yourself, and them. Remember, someone took a risk with you when you were
learning.
