My dad got a new Jeep (the black one below) that had been built up for
4-wheeling but had never been taken off road. We took it down to [Evan's
Creek][3] and ran through the 311 trail.

I've been to Evan's Creek twice and drove the 311 trail each time. There are
several other trails ([trail map][3]), but it was starting to rain and I had no
roof, so we headed home.
