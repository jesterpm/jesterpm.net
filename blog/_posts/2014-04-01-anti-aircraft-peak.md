April 1st I started Tuesday night hikes with a few friends after work.
Only Craig made it for the first hike to Anti-Aircraft Peak.

We parked at [10TET66806465 (NAD27)][2]  and took Clay Pit Rd to Klondike
Swamp Trail. The hike was pretty much flat until we turned onto Lost
Beagle Trail where we gained 240 ft in 0.7 miles (according to the green
trails map). We took the cut over to Tibbetts Marsh then went north to
Shangri La Trail. From there it was a short walk to the view point. Coming
back down we took Anti-Aircraft Ridge down instead of Lost Beagle and
Klondike.
