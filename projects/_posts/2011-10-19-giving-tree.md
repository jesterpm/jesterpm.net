Every year, [Foursquare Church][1] has the Christmas Giving Tree. A tree is setup
at the church with gift requests on tags. This web based application eases the
administrative burden by managing the application process, automatically
printing the tags, and tracking which tags have been taken and which have been
brought back with gifts.
