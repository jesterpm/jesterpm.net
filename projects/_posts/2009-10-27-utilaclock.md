Utilaclock is a simple clock utility. It opens any number of clocks in separate
windows. It can also create countdowns and timers. Count downs change color and
start counting up after they reach zero. The font size can now be set for each
clock.

Utilaclock is available on [GitHub](http://github.com/jesterpm/utilaclock).
Mac OS X binaries can be downloaded [here](/downloads/utilaclock.dmg)
([pgp signature](/downloads/utilaclock.dmg.asc)).
