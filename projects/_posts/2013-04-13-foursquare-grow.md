GROW is an web based discipleship tool created for [Foursquare Church][1].
The website takes the users through a survey to place them into one of
four levels and tracks their progress through videos specific to each
level.

GROW also integrates with the Fellowship One church management system.
Visit the live site at [http://foursquaregrow.com](http://foursquaregrow.com).

Interested in using Grow with your own church? [Contact
me](mailto:jesse@jesterpm.net). Or fork the code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/PuyallupFoursquare/foursquare-grow)!
